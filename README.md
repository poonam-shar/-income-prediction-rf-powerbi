# Income Prediction & Segmentation Analysis (>50K)
This project focuses on predicting whether an individual earns more than $50K annually using machine learning, and uncovering key insights through segmentation analysis with Power BI.

## Problem Statement
Predict whether a person earns over $50K per year based on demographic and work-related features. Evaluate the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, AUROC curve, and confusion matrix. Additionally, perform a segmentation study using a visualization tool to derive actionable insights.

## Machine Learning Overview
Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier

Target Variable: Income (<=50K or >50K)

Key Features: Age, Education, Occupation, Work Hours, Gender, Country, etc.

## Model Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: To be filled after model training

AUROC Score: To be filled

Precision / Recall / F1 Score: To be filled

Confusion Matrix: Used to analyze classification performance

## Segmentation Study with Power BI
An interactive dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize and analyze income distribution across various segments like education, gender, occupation, and age group.

## Key Insights
Total Individuals: 16K

Average Work Hours/Week: 40.39

% Earning >50K: 20%

Most Common Country: United States

Most Common Education: HS-grad

Most Common Occupation: Prof-specialty

## Visual Highlights
Education vs Income: Higher education levels like Doctorate and Masters have the highest % earning >50K.

Gender Distribution: 10.9K males vs 5.4K females, showing higher earnings among males.

Income by Age Group: Highest income seen in the 26â€“45 age range.

Occupation Trends: Prof-specialty and Exec-managerial roles dominate the >50K category.

Income Distribution: Only 19.6% of individuals earn >50K.

## Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

Power BI (Dashboards, DAX, Visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook (EDA and modeling)

Git & GitHub (Version control)

## Deliverables
